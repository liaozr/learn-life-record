# Example Vue.js Single Page App

### [Live demo](http://crudkit.com/vue-spa/)

This is my evolving attempt to build a full single page app with the vuejs ecosystem. This uses:

* [vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) for rendering
* [vue-router](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router) for routing
* [vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex) for state management
* [vuex-router-sync](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex-router-sync) to keep the router in sync with vuex
* The standard `vue-cli` based webpack build system and file layout

Coming Soon:

* Authentication and JWT
* Wrapping jQuery UI components into directives
* vue-resource usage
* vue-validator for validating forms
